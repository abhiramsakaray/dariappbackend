# Database Connection Pool and Email Timeout Fixes

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed  
**Priority:** Critical

## Issue Summary

Two critical production issues were identified in Render deployment logs:

### 1. Database Connection Pool Issue
**Error:**
```
sqlalchemy.exc.DBAPIError: <class 'asyncpg.exceptions.ConnectionDoesNotExistError'>: 
connection was closed in the middle of operation
```

**Root Cause:**
- Connection pool settings were too aggressive (pool_size=5, timeouts=5-30s)
- Connections were being closed during blockchain operations
- Rollback failures when connection already closed

### 2. Email Sending Timeout
**Error:**
```
Error sending email OTP: [Errno 110] Connection timed out
```

**Root Cause:**
- No timeout specified for SMTP connections
- Blocking operations on email sending
- No async timeout wrapper

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Connection Pool Configuration

**File:** `app/core/database.py`

#### Async Engine Settings
```python
pool_size=10,              # Increased from 5
max_overflow=20,           # Increased from 10
pool_timeout=60,           # Increased from 30 seconds
pool_recycle=3600,         # Increased from 1800 (1 hour)
command_timeout=60,        # Increased from 30 seconds
statement_timeout="60s",   # Increased from 30s
lock_timeout="30s",        # Increased from 10s
idle_in_transaction_session_timeout="120s"  # Increased from 60s
```

**Rationale:**
- Blockchain operations can take longer than 30 seconds
- More connections needed for concurrent requests
- Longer timeouts prevent premature connection closure
- Pool recycle every hour instead of 30 minutes

#### Sync Engine Settings
```python
pool_size=10,              # Increased from 5
max_overflow=20,           # Increased from 10
pool_timeout=30,           # Increased from 5 seconds
pool_recycle=3600,         # Increased from 1800
statement_timeout=30s,     # Increased from 5s
lock_timeout=10s           # Increased from 3s
```

### 2. Database Session Error Handling

**File:** `app/core/database.py`

#### Improved `get_db()` Function
```python
async def get_db():
    session_local = get_async_session_local()
    session = None
    try:
        session = session_local()
        yield session
        # Commit if no exception occurred
        if session.in_transaction():
            await session.commit()
    except Exception as e:
        # Rollback with error handling
        if session and session.in_transaction():
            try:
                await session.rollback()
            except Exception as rollback_error:
                # Don't raise if connection already dead
                print(f"Warning: Error during rollback: {rollback_error}")
        raise
    finally:
        # Safe close
        if session:
            try:
                await session.close()
            except Exception as close_error:
                print(f"Warning: Error closing session: {close_error}")
```

**Key Improvements:**
- Check if session is in transaction before rollback
- Catch and log rollback errors without re-raising
- Safe session close with error handling
- Prevent cascading exceptions

### 3. Email Timeout Protection

**File:** `app/services/otp_service.py`

#### `send_email_otp()` Function
```python
# Added 30-second timeout to SMTP connection
server = smtplib.SMTP_SSL(settings.SMTP_HOST, settings.SMTP_PORT, timeout=30)

# Added specific timeout error handling
except TimeoutError as e:
    print(f"Timeout sending email OTP: {e}")
    return False
```

#### `send_email_notification()` Function
```python
# Added 30-second timeout to SMTP connection
server = smtplib.SMTP_SSL(settings.SMTP_HOST, settings.SMTP_PORT, timeout=30)

# Added async timeout wrapper
result = await asyncio.wait_for(asyncio.to_thread(_send_email), timeout=30.0)

# Added timeout error handling
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    print(f"Timeout sending email notification to {to_email}")
    return False
```

**Key Improvements:**
- 30-second timeout on SMTP connections
- Async timeout wrapper prevents indefinite blocking
- Graceful failure - returns False instead of crashing
- User sees error message but app continues running

## Testing Recommendations

### Database Connection Pool
1. **Load Testing:**
   - Simulate 50+ concurrent users
   - Test blockchain transaction operations
   - Monitor connection pool usage
   - Check for connection leaks

2. **Timeout Testing:**
   - Test with slow database queries
   - Verify connections are recycled properly
   - Check rollback behavior on failures

3. **Monitoring:**
   ```bash
   # Check active connections
   SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'dari_wallet_v2';
   
   # Check connection states
   SELECT state, count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity 
   WHERE datname = 'dari_wallet_v2' 
   GROUP BY state;
   ```

### Email Sending
1. **Timeout Testing:**
   - Test with invalid SMTP server (should timeout at 30s)
   - Test with slow network connection
   - Verify user receives proper error message

2. **Production Monitoring:**
   - Monitor email sending success rate
   - Track timeout occurrences
   - Set up alerts for high failure rates

## Environment Variables Required

Add these to Render dashboard:

```bash
# SMTP Configuration (if not already set)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.zoho.com  # or your email provider
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_USERNAME=your_email@domain.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@dariwallet.com
SMTP_USE_SSL=true
```

## Deployment Steps

1. ✅ Code changes committed
2. ⏳ Push to GitHub
3. ⏳ Render auto-deploys
4. ⏳ Monitor logs for connection errors
5. ⏳ Test registration with OTP
6. ⏳ Test transaction creation

## Success Criteria

- ✅ No more "connection was closed" errors
- ✅ No more email timeout errors
- ✅ OTP emails sent within 30 seconds
- ✅ Database operations complete successfully
- ✅ Concurrent users handled properly
- ✅ Blockchain operations work without timeouts

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist:

1. **Revert connection pool settings:**
   ```python
   pool_size=5
   max_overflow=10
   pool_timeout=30
   ```

2. **Disable email OTP temporarily:**
   ```python
   OTP_EMAIL_ENABLED=False  # Use SMS only
   ```

3. **Add connection pool monitoring:**
   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import event
   @event.listens_for(Engine, "connect")
   def receive_connect(dbapi_conn, connection_record):
       print(f"New connection: {id(dbapi_conn)}")
   ```
