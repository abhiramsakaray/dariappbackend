```
Before: You received 100 USDC from abhi@dari
After:  You received 100 USDC from abhi@dari
```

**Files Modified:**

### 3. Real-time Push Notifications via Firebase
**What Changed:**

- ‚úÖ Multi-device support ready

**Files Created:**
1. `app/services/firebase_service.py` - FCM integration service
2. `alembic/versions/add_fcm_device_token.py` - Database migration
3. `docs/NOTIFICATION_ENHANCEMENTS.md` - Full documentation
4. `docs/FCM_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Setup instructions

**Files Modified:**
1. `app/models/user.py` - Added `fcm_device_token` field

4. `app/services/notification_service.py` - Integrated FCM calls

**New API Endpoints:**
```
POST   /api/v1/users/fcm-token   - Register device token
DELETE /api/v1/users/fcm-token   - Remove device token (logout)
```

**Database Changes:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN fcm_device_token VARCHAR(500);
```

---

## üîß Setup Required

### Backend Setup
1. **Get FCM Server Key** from Firebase Console
2. **Add to .env file:**
   ```env
   FCM_SERVER_KEY=your_firebase_server_key_here
   ```
3. **Run database migration:**
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```
4. **Restart server**

### Mobile App Setup
1. **Install push notification library** (Expo or Firebase)
2. **Request notification permissions**
3. **Get device token**
4. **Send token to backend:**
   ```
   POST /api/v1/users/fcm-token
   { "fcm_device_token": "device_token_here" }
   ```

See `docs/FCM_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions.

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Remove emojis
  - [ ] Check "Transaction Sent" notification
  - [ ] Check "Payment Received" notification
  - [ ] Check "Transaction Confirmed" notification
  - [ ] Check "Transaction Failed" notification

- [ ] Currency display
  - [ ] User with INR currency sees INR first
  - [ ] User with EUR currency sees EUR first
  - [ ] User with USD currency sees USDC
  - [ ] Token amount shown as secondary info

- [ ] Push notifications
  - [ ] FCM_SERVER_KEY configured
  - [ ] Device token registration works
  - [ ] Push sent on transaction created
  - [ ] Push sent on transaction confirmed
  - [ ] Badge count updates correctly
  - [ ] Deep linking to transaction works

---

## üìù Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```env
# Firebase Cloud Messaging
FCM_SERVER_KEY=AAAAxxxxxxx:APA91bH...

# Already exists (no changes needed)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://...
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

### Optional: Disable Push Notifications
If you want to disable FCM temporarily:
```env
# Leave FCM_SERVER_KEY empty or unset
FCM_SERVER_KEY=
```

Backend will gracefully skip push notifications and show:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  FCM_SERVER_KEY not configured - skipping push notification
```

---

## üîê Security Notes

1. **FCM Server Key**: Keep this SECRET! Never expose in client code
2. **Device Tokens**: Stored securely in database
3. **Token Validation**: Backend validates before sending
4. **Rate Limiting**: FCM has built-in rate limits
5. **Token Refresh**: Mobile app should refresh tokens periodically
